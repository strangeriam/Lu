(c) Wouter Dhondt (http://www.kwakkelflap.com)

Usage:
Fping.exe <host(-list)> [-t time] [-w timeout] [-c] [-n count] [-s data_size]
       [-S size1/size2] [-R min/max] [-d ping_data] [-h TTL] [-v TOS]
       [-r routes] [-f] [-j] [-g host1/host2] [-H filename] [-a] [-A]
       [-p(x)] [-i] [-b(-)] [-T] [-D] [-l] [-o] [-L filename]

Options:
        -t : time between 2 pings in ms up to 1000000
        -w : timeout in ms to wait for each reply
        -c : continuous ping (higher priority than -n)
             to see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
             to stop - type Control-C.
        -n : number of pings to send to each host
        -s : amount of data in bytes up to 65500
        -S : size sweep: ping with size1, size1 + 1, ..., size2 bytes
        -R : random length between min and max (disabled when using -S)
        -d : ping with specified data
        -h : number of hops (TTL: 1 to 128) + print hops
        -v : Type Of Service (0 to 255) (IPv4-only)
        -r : record route (1 to 9 routes) (IPv4-only)
        -f : set Don't Fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only)
        -j : print jitter with each reply (only when pinging one host)
        -g : ping IP range from host1 to host2 (IPv4-only)
        -H : get hosts from filename (comma delimited, filename with full path)
        -a : resolve addresses to hostnames
        -A : print addresses with each reply
        -p : use a thread pool to ping multiple hosts (enables ICMP dll)
             x is optional and allows you to choose the number of threads
             e.g. -p uses a thread for every host
                  -p5 uses a pool of 5 threads/core
        -i : use ICMP dll instead of raw socket (disables -r)
        -b : beep on every successful reply (-b- to beep on timeout)
        -T : print timestamp with each reply
        -D : print datestamp with each reply
        -l : limit the output to ping results and errors
        -o : limit the output to ping statistics
        -L : logging to a text file
